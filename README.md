# Python for lunch!

## Introduction
Many IMAU folks currently use Python for parts of their workflow or have expressed interest in doing so. Yet the suite of packages available for geophysical science is quite extensive and therefore it can be hard to pick the right one. On top of that, learning a new language or developing a new workflow from scratch can be quite time-consuming. It makes you wonder, if only there was a fun and efficient way of mastering new Python skills… Enter `Python for Lunch!`.

`Python for lunch!` is an informal seminar series held every two weeks centred around Python. Each session has a focus which can be a package, a workflow, an aspect of programming... you name it. Next to that we intend to make room for a users-helping-users kind of thing, both online and offline, so we can maximally benefit from each others knowledge. The overall goal being to spend less time on re-inventing the wheel and more on doing cool science!
